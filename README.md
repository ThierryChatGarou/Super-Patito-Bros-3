<h4 align="center">Super patito bros 3 game in C</h4>

A game made in C for MSDOS for my first semester of programming university assigment.<br>
The code is in spanish.<br>
Made when I was learning to program so you should expect all sort of bad programming practices and not many complex features of the C language, it has almost no pointers nor structures because I didn't understand them.<br><br>
<br>
The code compiles with Turbo C++ 3.0 under MSDOS and with MinGW32-gcc-3.4.5 using codeblocks.<br>
The game compiled for MSDOS runs well in Windows 98.<br>
If compiled with MinGW it runs fine from  Windows XP to Windows 10.<br>
It has been tested with a Pentium 3 at 500MHz and 256MB RAM.<br>
The MSDOS version using Windows XP integrated 16 bit emulator and has a little bit of latency and slows downs at times but is playable.<br>
With DosBox is playable if CPU cicles are speed up.<br>
The Win32 Version runs nice on Windows XP, no issues.<br>
The code has been uploaded as is and each commit was a zip file backup and the code wasn't tested before each commit.<br>

## To do:
* Proper readme with compilation intructions.
* Spanish version of the readme
* English version of the code.
* Test it under Windows 11.
* make it run in Linux and other systems.


## Key Features

* Giant C files with messy code with thousands of lines.
  - Explore what's like to see code from a newbie.
  - Get crazy trying to understand this mess, however is not nothing as bad as Neil Ferguson's calculator when it got used.
* Simple C code (the MSDOS version)
  - No pointers, no structures, typedefs, complex macros. It's really code from 1st semester.
* Almost bug free. 
  - No major bugs, memory leaks or crashes have been spotted.
* No instructions on how to use it. 
* Incomplete game without final boss.
* My teacher would not believe I actually did this myself.
